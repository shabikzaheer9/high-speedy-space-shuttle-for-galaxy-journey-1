During the creation of the universe in 1035sec, particles and anti particles were collided with each other. As a result, photon was generated and temperature was increased into 1028 degree Kelvin (according to GUT ) . According to this concept, a space shuttle can be made that can achieve one-third speed of light. By this shuttle, we can visit the galaxy, research about the existence of alien. We can explore planet like earth which is habitable for us. Except this, according to the theory of relativity, if the space shuttle come back in the earth again it will travel into the future.
